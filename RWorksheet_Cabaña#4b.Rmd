## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

#1) Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.

vectorA <- matrix(1:5,5,5)
for (i in seq_len(nrow(vectorA))) {
  for (j in seq_len(ncol(vectorA))) {
  print(vectorA[i,j])
  }
}

```
```{r}
#2) Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in the Figure.

for(i in 1:5)
  cat(paste0("\"",rep("*",i),"\""),"\n")


```
```{r}
#3) Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.

num <- as.numeric(readline("Enter a number: "))
a <-0
b <-1

repeat {
  if(a > 500){
    break
  }
  print(a)
  c <- a + b
  a <- b
  b <- c
}
```

```{r}
